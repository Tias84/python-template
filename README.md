# Python Project Boilerplate

This repository serves as a boilerplate for future Python projects. It includes a basic structure and setup to help you get started quickly.

## Project Structure
```
my-project/
├── my_project/
│ ├── __init__.py
│ └── main.py
├── tests/
│ └── __init__.py
├── data/
├── docs/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── requirements.txt
└── setup.py
```

## Virtual Environment
Use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

Create a new virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Dependencies
To install the project dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install package_name
```

To update the `requirements.txt` file with the latest dependencies, run:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

To install all dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
